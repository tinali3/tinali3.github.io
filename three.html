      <h3>Designing Interface Animation</h3>
      <h4>16.10.24</h4>
      <p>The article “Design Interface Animation” discusses the idea of using
        animation in order to express a brand and to tell its story. Animation
        can show the bigger picture of the project as a whole, but it can also
        break it down to the smallest detailed components. This design choice
        can lead to a more consistent theme or design for the overall brand
        which will strengthen it. The animation also helps with communication
        between the project and the audience.</p>

      <p>It also included “motion audit” which is used for already existing
        animations. It collects all the animations into one place to identify
        the common animations or duplicates. The article states that it will
        focus the animations and the design reasons they are used for. However,
        the reason for motion auditing is also confusing. The branding is
        supposed to include a cohesive design to it but the animations aren’t
        supposed to be too similar</p>

      <p>I agree that the idea of using animation creates a more expressive
        branding and adds more personality to it. Using animation to showcase
        a brand or project gives a more interactive feel for the audience that
        it looking at it and also makes it more appealing.</p>
