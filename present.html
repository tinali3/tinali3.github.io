          <p>Today, the instant camera has regained popularity amongst the youth
            as a way to take and share memories with friends. It captures moments
            in film that can be used to decorate space or just kept as a keepsake
            in a photobook like the olden times.</p>

          <p>The new style of instant film also changed the way photos were
            developed. The integral instant color film sheets took place of the
            positive and negative films. The color film sheets are composed of
            multiple color layers: top layer is sensitive to blue light, middle
            is sensitive to green light, and bottom is sensitive to red light.
            When the film is exposed to light, the photons react to the layers
            to create the chemically based record that is squeezed between a
            bottom black base layer and four additional layers: acid, timing,
            image, and reagent layer.</p>

          <p>Polaroid was not the only company that was producing instant
            cameras. Japanâ€™s company, Fujifilm, started manufacturing their own
            line of instant cameras since 1900s. One of the most popular models
            of instant cameras recently has been the Fujifilm Instax Mini 8. The
            small compact size and pastel colors appeal to the generation of
            having an aesthetic style and photos. </p>

          <p>In terms of designers and artists, instant cameras became popular
            amongst them as well. Andy Warhol was captivated by the colors and
            used it for a series of instant portraits. Another artist, David
            Hockney created a series of landscape panoramas made up of entirely
            polaroid films. The speed and ease of the self-developing film
            increased the desire for photographers in the advertising and cinema
            world who could assess light, shade and composition on set before
            they actually started shooting with more conventional cameras.</p>

          <p>The advancement of technology decreased the popularity of the
            instant camera but it has been rediscovered and become a trendy
            piece of technology with a new audience.</p>
