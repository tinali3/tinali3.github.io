          <p>The beginning of the polaroid camera started with a three year old
            girl that asked a simple question, why couldnâ€™t she see the photo
            right away? That three year old girl was the daughter of the scientist
            and inventor, Edwin Land. Land was at a loss for words and decided to
            try and create a system that would accomplish such a task.  In 1948,
            the first polaroid camera was born. On November 26, 1948, the first
            Land camera was sold at Jordan Marsh department store in Boston,
            Massachusetts.</p>

          <p>The company, Polaroid was founded in 1937 by Edwin H. Land. The
            original polaroid camera, Land Model 95, used film that was made up
            of two separate positive and negative rolls which enabled the image
            to be developed inside the camera. With the production of only 60
            cameras during the holidays, all units and film supplies were sold
            out in one day. The unforeseen demand for them motivated Land to
            improve upon his ideas with different types of film.</p>

          <p>In 1963, Polaroid released a new instant camera that was the first
            fully automatic pack film and exposure control camera. They called
            it the Land Model 100 and it introduced most of the features that would
            become the most common across the higher end models in that range.</p>

          <p>As new models came out, they became more inexpensive and included
            better features that made the camera easier to use. The Polaroid
            OneStep Land camera was one of them. It was a fixed-focus camera and
            it became the best-selling camera overall in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Model 95 Land camera became the prototype design for
            all Polaroid Land cameras for the next 15 years.</p>

          <p> However, as the world evolved into a more technological age and
            everything was starting to digitalize, the idea of film cameras
            was declining as digital cameras took place.</p>
