          <p>With the constant movement towards digitalized technology, instant
            cameras don’t seem to have a chance compared to the digital cameras
            right? Actually, Polaroid has designed the new Snap+ digital camera
            which is an upgrade to a modern instant camera with features such as
            an improved camera, a 3.5” touchscreen, and the ability to capture
            1080p HD video.  Also, including a self-timer and a pop-up selfie
            mirror make it the best way to capture perfect selfies which gained
            popularity in this recent age.</p>

          <p>The Snap+ is still an instant camera so it instantly prints physical
            2 x 3 photos, either as a photo or a sticker. However, it goes a
            step further with a more advanced feature. Basically, anyone with
            smartphone can connect via Bluetooth and use it as a portable photo
            printer. Printing is quick and easy with the use of special paper
            which it heats up to create the colors instead of ink.</p>

          <p>These new features added to the basic instant camera can change the
            way people and photographers integrate instant cameras into their
            lifestyle. Being able to take photos and be in control of whether
            or not it prints is a desirable feature. It seems very similar to a
            regular digital camera and just printing the photo. However, the
            quality and design of the polaroid makes it a unique and stylish
            experience.</p>
