      <h2>teletype.online</h2>
      <h3>16.10.6</h3>
      <p>Teletype.online is a website designed to promote a product that is a
        messenger used to connect businesses and managers. The website opens up
        with an animation that brings the reader in and displays the product.</p>
      <p>This site is very minimal but has very good usage of color, animation,
        and hierarchy. The customization of the color for the site gives
        personality to the product as well as gives the reader the opportunity
        to pick a color. The animated image that displays the product being
        presented shows the emotions that product can present while printing.
        The visual hierarchy draws the eyes to the product when the site is
        opened up and brings the attention to the center of the page.</p>
      <p>The site is very simple but it lacks details the user might need to
        understand the product. The navigation is confined to scrolling down and
        up. There is also no text explaining the sections that the site
        contains. Agency info for the creators is on the bottom right but it is
        not very visible.</p>
