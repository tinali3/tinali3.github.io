      <h3>teletype.online</h3>
      <h4>16.10.5</h4>

      <p>Teletype.online is a website designed to promote a product that is a
        messenger used to connect businesses and managers. The website opens up
        with an animation that brings the reader in and displays the product.</p>
      <p>This site is very minimal but has very good usage of color, animation,
        and hierarchy. The customization of the color for the site gives
        personality to the product as well as gives the reader the opportunity
        to pick a color. The animated image that displays the product being
        presented shows the emotions that product can present while printing.
        The visual hierarchy draws the eyes to the product when the site is
        opened up and brings the attention to the center of the page.</p>
      <p>The site is very simple but it lacks details the user might need to
        understand the product. The navigation is confined to scrolling down and
        up. There is also no text explaining the sections that the site
        contains. Agency info for the creators is on the bottom right but it is
        not very visible.</p>

        <h3>coffee shop</h3>
        <h4>16.10.10</h4>
        <a href="coffee-shop.html">
            <img src="images/header01.jpg" alt="coffee-shop" width="960" height="318">
        </a>
        <p>With our first assignment, we created and formatted a coffee shop blog
          that was design on Photoshop. As we went through styling the page together,
          there were many different tags and styles that were used in order to organize
           the page neatly. The formatting of the page made sense with the different
           sections such as header, navigation, article, and footer. A separate
           stylesheet was also used to keep track of the styling of the page and also
           used across the roasters page as well with the help of the link tag.</p>
       <p>While working on the roasters page, it went pretty smoothly since
          it only required the change in paragraphs, different header image, and an
          additional image at the bottom of the page. Linking the roaster page to the main
          coffee shop home was easy as well since the <<strong><em>a</em></strong>> tag was already in place
          for the link to be added. The only problem that occurred to me was
          forgetting to end the tag for the navigation which threw off the navigation
          bar and added an extra box. </p>
        <p>Overall, the coding for this blog made a lot of sense to me and
          was pretty straight forward. The only thing I would do to do better
          next time is to be more cautious of the coding and make sure the syntax
          is right in order to save a lot of time.</p>
